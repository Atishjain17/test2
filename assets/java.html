<div class="toggle-content" >
<p>&nbsp Java is:<br>
<ul>
<li>Object Oriented </li>
<li>Platform independent:</li>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Secure</li>
<li>Architectural- neutral</li>
<li>Portable</li>
<li>Robust</li>
<li>Multi-threaded </li>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> How Java enabled High Performance?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Java uses Just-In-Time compiler to enable high performance. Just-In-Time compiler is a program that turns Java bytecode, which is a program that contains instructions that must be interpreted into instructions that can be sent directly to the processor.</p>
</div>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> Why Java is considered dynamic?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.</p>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is Java Virtual Machine and how it is considered in context of Java’s platform independent feature?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>When Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run.</p> 
</div>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What do you mean by Object and class?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Object is a runtime entity and it’s  state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods. Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.</p> 
<p>A class is a blue print from which individual objects are created. A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What do you mean by Constructor?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Constructor gets invoked when a new object is created. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class the java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.</p>
</div>

<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is a static variable?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.</p>
</div>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is an Exception?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. Exceptions are caught by handlers positioned along the thread's method invocation stack.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What do you mean by Checked Exceptions?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It is an exception that is typically a user error or a problem that cannot be foreseen by the programmer. For example, if a file is to be opened, but the file cannot be found, an exception occurs. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation.</p> 
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> Explain Runtime Exceptions?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It is an exception that occurs that probably could have been avoided by the programmer. As opposed to checked exceptions, runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.</p>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> Define Inheritance?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It is the process where one object acquires the properties of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> When super keyword is used?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>If the method overrides one of its superclass's methods, overridden method can be invoked through the use of the keyword super. It can be also used to refer to a hidden field.</p>
</div>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is Polymorphism?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is Abstraction?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>It refers to the ability to make a class abstract in OOP. It helps to reduce the complexity and also improves the maintainability of the system.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is Abstract class and when are they used?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>These classes cannot be instantiated and are either partially implemented or not at all implemented. This class contains one or more abstract methods which are simply method declarations without a body.</p>
<p>If you want a class to contain a particular method but you want the actual implementation of that method to be determined by child classes, you can declare the method in the parent class as abstract.</p>
<p>The main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our code. With this Encapsulation gives maintainability, flexibility and extensibility to our code.</p>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is an Interface and give some of its features?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>An interface is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.</p>
<p>It includes −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Interface cannot be instantiated</p></li>
<li><p>An interface does not contain any constructors.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the methods in an interface are abstract.</p></li>
</ul>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> Define Packages in Java and why are they used?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>A Package can be defined as a grouping of related types(classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations ) providing access protection and name space management.</p>
<p>Packages are used in Java in-order to prevent naming conflicts, to control access, to make searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations, etc., easier.</p>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What do you mean by Multithreaded program?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.</p>

<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is function overriding?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class, it is known as Method Overriding.</p>

<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What are Wrapper classes?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">

<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> Is there any limitation of using Inheritance?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Yes, since inheritance inherits everything from the super class and interface, it may make the subclass too clustering and sometimes error-prone when dynamic overriding or dynamic overloading in some situation.</p>
</div>

<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> Can you call one constructor from another if a class has multiple constructors?</label>

<section class="toggle">
<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>An abstract class can have instance methods that implement a default behavior. An Interface can only declare constants and instance methods, but cannot implement default behavior and all methods are implicitly abstract. An interface has all public members and no implementation.</p>
