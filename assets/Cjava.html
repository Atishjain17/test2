<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is the difference between C and Java?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>1. JAVA is Object-Oriented while C is procedural.<br>
Most differences between the features of the two languages arise due to the use of differentprogramming paradigms. C breaks down to functions while JAVA breaks down to Objects. C is more procedure-oriented while JAVA is data-oriented.<br>
<br>2. Java is an Interpreted language while C is a compiled language.<br>
We all know what a compiler does. It takes your code & translates it into something the machine can understand-that is to say-0’s & 1’s-the machine-level code. That’s exactly what happens with our C code-it gets ‘compiled’. While with JAVA, the code is first transformed to what is called the bytecode. This bytecode is then executed by the JVM(Java Virtual Machine). For the same reason, JAVA code is more portable.
<br><br>3.C is a low-level language while JAVA is a high-level language.<br>
C is a low-level language(difficult interpretation for the user, closer significance to the machine-level code) while JAVA is a high-level lagunage(abstracted from the machine-level details, closer significance to the program itself).
<br><br>4. C uses the top-down {sharp & smooth} approach while JAVA uses the bottom-up {on the rocks} approach.<br>
In C, formulating the program begins by defining the whole and then splitting them into smaller elements. JAVA(and C++ and other OOP languages) follows the bottom-up approach where the smaller elements combine together to form the whole.
<br><br>5. Pointer go backstage in JAVA while C requires explicit handling of pointers.<br>
When it comes to JAVA, we don’t need the *’s & &’s to deal with pointers & their addressing. More formally, there is no pointer syntax required in JAVA. It does what it needs to do. While in JAVA, we do create references for objects.

<div class="toggle-content">
<p>
A structure is a collection of variables under a single name. These variables can be of different types, and each has a name which is used to select it from the structure. A structure is a convenient way of grouping several pieces of related information together.</p>

<p> Get the two’s compliment of the same positive integer. <br>Eg: 1101 (-5)
1: One’s compliment of 5 : 1010<br>
2: Add 1 to above, giving 1011, which is -5<br>

<div class="toggle-content">
<p>The preprocessor provides the ability for the inclusion of header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control. In many implementations, it is a separate program invoked by the compiler as the first part of translation.</p>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i> What is null pointer ?</label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>Literal meaning of NULL pointer is a pointer which is pointing to nothing. NULL pointer points the base address of segment.<br>
Examples of NULL pointer:<br>
 int *ptr=(char *)0;<br>
 float *ptr=(float *)0;<br>
 char *ptr=(char *)0;<br>
 double *ptr=(double *)0;<br>
 char *ptr=’\0’;<br>
 int *ptr=NULL;<br>

<label><i class="icon icon-minus"></i><i class="icon icon-plus"></i>What are the different storage classes in C? </label>
<div class="toggle-content">
<p>C has three types of storage. Automatic, static and allocated. <br>
Automatic storage duration is for variables having block scope without static specifier.<br>
Static storage is for variables having block scope and with static specifier.<br>
It is also for global variables with or without static specifier. Memory obtained from calls to malloc, calloc, relloc belongs to allocated storage class.<br>

<div class="toggle-content">
<p>We can modify constant variable with the help of pointers. For example:<br>

#include<stdio.h><br>
int main(){<br>
    int i=10;<br>
    int *ptr=&i;<br>
    *ptr=(int *)20;<br>
    printf("%d",i);<br>
    return 0;<br>

Output: 20
